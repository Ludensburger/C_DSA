# C_DataStructures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++, including DynamicArray, Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Queue, and a custom HashMap. Each data structure utilizes virtual method code structuring for abstraction to facilitate ease of use and maintainability.

## Data Structures Implemented:

- **DynamicArray:** A resizable array that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and access to elements.
- **Singly Linked List:** A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Similar to a singly linked list, but each element also points to the previous element.
- **Stack:** A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure that supports push and pop operations.
- **Queue:** A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure that supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **HashMap:** A custom implementation utilizing an array of nodes, where each node holds a key and a linked list of values associated with that key.

## Usage:

Each data structure has its own main menu for demonstration and testing purposes. Additionally, there is a `driver.exe` written in C++ that serves as a centralized main menu for accessing and testing all data structures.

### Using the Data Structures:

Each data structure comes with its own main menu, allowing users to interact with it independently. This setup facilitates testing and understanding of individual data structures.

### Centralized Driver Program:

The `driver.exe` is designed to provide a centralized main menu for accessing and testing all implemented data structures. However, it's important to note that the paths in the code are based on my local directory structure. Users who clone this repository to their local machine must make necessary changes to the code in `driver.cpp` to reflect their directory paths. This ensures that the driver program functions correctly in their environment.

### How to Customize `driver.cpp`:

To customize `driver.cpp` for your directory structure:

1. Open `driver.cpp` in a text editor or an IDE.
2. Locate any file paths specified in the code.
3. Replace these file paths with the appropriate paths in your local directory structure.
4. Save the changes.

By customizing `driver.cpp` with your directory paths, you can ensure that the centralized driver program functions as expected in your environment.

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute `driver.exe` to access the main menu for all implemented data structures.
4. Follow the prompts to interact with and test each data structure.

## Contributing:

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and guidelines.

In this repository, you'll find implementations of common data structures in C++. Each structure is designed with abstraction in mind, using virtual methods for code structuring. The implemented data structures include DynamicArray, Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Queue, and a custom HashMap. To facilitate testing and demonstration, each structure comes with its own main menu. Additionally, there's a centralized driver program in C++ that acts as the main menu for all data structures. Contributions to this project are encouraged.
